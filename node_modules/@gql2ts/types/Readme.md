# @gql2ts/types

This package defines common types and interfaces used in `@gql2ts` packages.

It is very useful if you are looking to extend or develop any of these packages.

For instance, `IFromQueryOptions` will be extremely useful if you are developing a new language extension or are looking to override defaults in `@gql2ts/from-query`.
